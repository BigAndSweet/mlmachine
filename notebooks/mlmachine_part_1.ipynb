    "We now have a DataFrame with encoded columns, all clearly named. Let's take this `PandasFeatureUnion` branch by branch:\n",
    "- \"nominal\" pipeline - Here we see the flexibility of `DataFrameSelector()`. First, we select all nominal columns by passing `[\"nominal\"]` to the `include_mlm_dtypes` parameter. `DataFrameSelector()` directly references `mlm_dtypes` to make column selections. Second, we exclude \"Cabin\" (also a nominal feature) by passing the feature name to the `exclude_columns` parameter. `DataFrameSelector()` reconciles our include/exclude specifications by selecting all nominal columns except \"Cabin\". Lastly, we pass our selected columns to `OneHotEncoder()`, wrapped in `PandasTransformer()`.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"ordinal\" pipeline - We again us the `DataFrameSelector()` parameter `include_mlm_dtypes`, this time to select all ordinal columns. Then we pass our result to `OrdinalEncoder()`, wrapped in `PandasTransformer()`. We also provide encoding instructions. When we instantiated our `Machine()` object, we passed in a dictionary called `ordinal_encodings`, which `mlmachine_titanic` stores as an attribute. We wrap this dictionary's values in a list and pass it to the `OrdinalEncoder()` parameter `categories`. This will ensure the desired hierarchy is enforced during encoding.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"bin\" pipeline - We again use `include_mlm_dtypes` to select all continuous features and pass the result to `KBinsDiscretizer()`, wrapped in `PandasTransformer()`.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"diff\" pipeline - The last step is to recombine any features that would otherwise be lost in the union operation, and drop any features we no longer need. We perform a list comprehension on the `mlm_dtypes` attribute to remove \"Cabin\", and append the keys of `mlmachine_titanic.ordinal_encodings` to the result. This will ensure that the original nominal and ordinal features are not in the transformed dataset, but that we retain \"Cabin\". Notice that we do not exclude the continuous columns, despite the fact we transformed these features with `KBinsDiscretizer()`. The reason is simple - we want to keep the original continuous columns in our dataset.\n",
